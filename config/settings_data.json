After years of offering wholesale products, they decided to take a risk and start designing their own original, high quality silhouettes that couldn&#x27;t be found anywhere else. The stars aligned and the girls met Madeline, a marketing guru who felt a pull to go all-in on her own business. Tash and Whit had the vision and Madeline, a fellow dress loverÂ seekingÂ to empower women, knew how to tell the world about it. She joined the team in 2018 and Ivy City Co. 2.0 was officially born.Â <\/p>",
